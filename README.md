🎨 UI Design
------------

I have designed a simple and clean user interface for this project..

🚀 Features
-----------

-   Made a basic JSX structure and used components and props.
-   Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces and think about each piece in isolation. You can find a detailed component API reference [here](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html).
-   Implemented Hooks.
-   Used `useState` to declare the default state of components.
-   Implemented dark and light modes.
-   Implemented NewsAPI
